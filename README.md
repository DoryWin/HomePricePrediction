# Real Estate Price Prediction Website

## Overview
This project is a step-by-step guide on how to build a real estate price prediction website. The project consists of three main components:

1. **Machine Learning Model:** We develop a model using `sklearn` and linear regression with the **Bangalore home prices dataset** from Kaggle.
2. **Flask Server:** A Python Flask server is built to serve HTTP requests using the trained model.
3. **Frontend Website:** A user-friendly web interface is created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, where users can input home details (square footage, bedrooms, etc.), and the model will predict the price.

This project covers a wide range of **data science concepts**, including:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Outlier detection and removal
- Feature engineering
- Dimensionality reduction
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- K-Fold cross-validation

## Technology Stack
This project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

### **Machine Learning & Data Science**
- **Python**
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data cleaning)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Scikit-Learn** (for model building)
- **Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm** (as IDEs)

### **Backend**
- **Flask** (to create an HTTP server for model inference)

### **Frontend**
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (to build a user interface)
